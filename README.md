This repository is used to build XLA-related artifacts such as PJRT plugin binaries for multiple platforms.
It was inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/zml/pjrt-artifacts) with various modifications to
include support for Windows as well as build binaries that include more than just PJRT such as the ability
to build StableHLO programs using the MLIR C API.
